Installation
============
Python is required to use openTorsion. You can install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/).

OpenTorsion can be installed using the Python package installer ``pip`` (https://pypi.org/project/pip/)::

    pip install opentorsion
    
Alternatively, if ``git`` is installed, the repository can be cloned::
    
    git clone https://github.com/Aalto-Arotor/openTorsion.git
    
This creates a folder *opentorsion* containing the openTorsion source code.
